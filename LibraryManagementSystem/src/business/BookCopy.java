 * Immutable class

 * returns a mutable value -- in particular, whether <code>book</code>
 * is mutable. The only mutable variable in Book is the
 * BookCopy array, but there is no getter for this array. Book
 * is therefore immutable (see Book class comments), and os
 * BookCopy is also immutable.
